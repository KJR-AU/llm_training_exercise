    "### Defining Tests\n",
    "In TruLens, a test consists of two elements, prompts and feedback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of evaluating LLM-powered applications, prompts refer to the input queries or instructions given to the model to generate responses or predictions. Prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of the model, as they frame the task or question the model is expected to address. By providing a range of carefully designed prompts, evaluators can test the model’s ability to handle different types of input, ensuring it responds accurately and appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompt design is essential for thorough evaluation, as it reveals the model's strengths, limitations, and behavior across different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prompt Sets\n",
    "Our evaluation framework provides the `Prompt` and `PromptSet` classes to faciliate loading and interacting with prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `Prompt` is a single input provided to the target application. A `Prompt` consists of several fields, an input, an optional expected response from the application and an optional context. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `PromptSet` is a set of one or more related `Prompts`. A PromptSet is defined in JSON format. You can see an example of the JSON format in `./relevance-4a.json`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet below, we import the PromptSet class and load our prompts from the file they are defined in, then iterate over the prompt set and print the individual prompts."

    "### Metrics\n",
    "Metrics evaluate a target model's performance when responding to one or more prompts. A metric assesses the models performance in regard to a specific category, such as the presence of hate speech, or the groundedness of the response in the provided context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most metrics are backed by an LLM, known as the provider model. This can (but doesn't have to be) the same model used by the application being evaluated. The metric is essentially a prompt which asks the provider model to score the target applications response against a rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, for example when attempting to detect the presence of personal information in a response, it is necessary to use a provider model than can be run locally, such as llama3, to ensure that personal information is not exposed to a proprietary model where it could be retained for training purposes.\n",
    "\n",
