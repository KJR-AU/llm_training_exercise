# Exercise 2 - LLM Test Planning
Assume you’re deploying a private LLM for the purpose of providing an internal chat-bot that can answer questions about your HR policy.​

* What kinds of tests need to be run, based on the risks that you’d previously identified?​

* What kind of test data will you need?​

* What measures of quality would be most relevant?​

* Are there any metrics that should get a higher priority ​(e.g. is precision more important than recall or vice versa?)
